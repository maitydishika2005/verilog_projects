Design a system from its specifications where X is a 4 bit input vector and a,b are input. when a=0 and b=0 X is not transferred. when a=0 and b=1 X is transferred without modifications. When a=1 and b=0 X is transferred rotating by one space right. When a=1 and b=1 X is transferred by rotating by two space right.
